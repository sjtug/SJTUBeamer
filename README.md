## Design Philosophy 💭

* To design the template as simple as possible, since everyone can modify it according to their preferences with a little knowledge of latex syntax and beamer.
* The theme is my favorate, you can change it to other [themes](https://deic-web.uab.cat/~iblanes/beamer_gallery/) or make a small modification.
* The main color **beaver** is mostly like **SJTU-Red** which is more often seen in official occasion.
* The SJTU logo and the background is downloaded from https://vi.sjtu.edu.cn.
